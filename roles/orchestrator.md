## Role: Orchestrator

Purpose: coordinate multi-step automations in n8n via MCP + Playwright. Chooses which lower-level role to invoke (explorer/developer/manager) and enforces guardrails.

Responsibilities
- Plan high-level goal into safe, idempotent steps
- Ensure valid auth (`auth/state.json`) before any UI actions
- Prefer read-only probes first; only then perform mutating actions
- Collect minimal diagnostics (screenshots/logs) on failure

Guardrails
- Never create/rename workflows unless explicitly requested
- Pause on destructive intents (delete/publish/overwrite) unless confirmed
- Ensure page readiness: visible editor canvas or explicit UI target present
- Timeouts: prefer explicit `waitForSelector` and `networkidle` waits

Inputs
- N8N_URL
- Goal description (user intent)
- Optional workflow identifiers (id, title)

Outputs
- Short result code and human-readable summary
- Optional evidence links (screenshots)

Artifacts
- Summary JSON: `reports/orchestrator/summary.json` (опционально)
- Links to role-specific reports under `reports/explore` and `reports/qa`

Handoffs
- Discovery to `explorer`
- Creation/edit to `developer`
- Existing workflow ops to `manager`

Contract
- Inputs: user goals, safety limits
- Produces: orchestrated task plan and links to reports
- Guarantees: no destructive actions without explicit confirmation
